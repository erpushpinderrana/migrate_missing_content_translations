  # Since the actual Images have already migrated as part of media image migration so
  # map the relevant fid in the destination field. Though we can't use the OOTB
  # Migration Lookup module as the existing base/source migration plugins are no longer
  # available. Hence, developed custom lookup to use the existing migration
  # mapping tables to get the correct destination id. The custom_migration_lookup
  # plugin gets the destination id from the existing mapping table i.e. migrate_map_media_image.
  # Now the processor knows for what node needs to be added.
  
  # Example: In D7, there is a banner image which fid is 2 (source language). Since the source
  # language migration is already taken place so we could directly fetch the destination id
  # by looking in the old existing migration mapping table i.e migrate_map_media_image.
  # Note all the migration mapping table starts with `migrate_map_`.
  # Let's say the destination fid for 2 is 201 in this table. So this migration look up
  # will return 201.
