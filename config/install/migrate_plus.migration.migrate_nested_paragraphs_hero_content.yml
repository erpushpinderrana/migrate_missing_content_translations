  # Mapping Blogs References field between D7 Hero Content - Field Collection and D9 Paragraph.
  # Since the Blogs Reference field is a node reference field so we should use Migration Lookup.
  # Though we can't use the OOTB Migration Lookup module as the existing base/source migration
  # plugins are no longer available. Hence, developed custom lookup to use the existing migration
  # mapping tables to get the correct destination id. The custom_migration_lookup
  # plugin gets the destination id from the existing mapping table i.e. migrate_map_type_article.
  # Now the processor knows for what node needs to be added.
  
  # Example: In D7, there is a Blog node nid 2 (source language). Since the source language migration
  # is already taken place so we could directly fetch the destination id by looking in the old
  # existing migration mapping table i.e migrate_map_type_blogs.
  # Note all the migration mapping table starts with `migrate_map_`.
  # Let's say the destination id for 2 is 201 in this table. So this migration look up will return 201.
  # Once we know the destination id then it is just a matter of process the correct mapping.
